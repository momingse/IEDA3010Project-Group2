# IEDA3010 Project

## Description

The code in this repository is used to optimize the exam schedule problem. 

### The Optimization Model

The sample data is provided in the data folder with filename start with "data". The ***main.ipynb*** file is the main file to run the code. The ***test.lp*** contains the linear programming model

### Visualization of Model Results

The result is saved as csv in the repository with filename start with "result". The ***plot.ipynb*** file is used to visualize the result. 

## Pre-requisites

run main.ipynb with the corresponding data files in the same directory

## Run

1. Change the `dataset` value in the main.ipynb file to the dataset you want to run (either 22 or 95)
2. run all cells in the main.ipynb file
